-----------

Terms:

Dice Types - D&D uses 7 different types of dice througout the game. These dice are represented by a "d" followed by the number of sides the dice has. 
All of the different dice are as follows: 
- d4
- d6
- d8
- d10
- d12
- d20
- d100
Note: This program allows for "any" type of dice to be rolled, so yes you can roll a d2 or a d500.
As the game is played, several of the same dice might be rolled at the same time, this is represented by the number of times the dice is rolled followed by the type of dice rolled. For example, rolling four d6s would be represented as 4d6.

Modified roll - A roll with additions/modifiers
